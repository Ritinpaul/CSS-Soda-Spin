# CSS Soda Spin

CSS Soda Spin is a project that showcases a 3D soda can animation created entirely with CSS. The animation features a smooth transition between two soda can designs, giving the illusion of a 3D rotation effect.
This project is also fully responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across various screen sizes.

## Features

- **Pure CSS 3D Animation:** The project achieves the 3D rotating effect using only CSS, with no JavaScript involved.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts seamlessly for different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Modern CSS Properties:** Utilizes advanced CSS properties like `aspect-ratio`, `background-blend-mode`, and `mask-image` to create complex visuals.

## Project Structure

- **HTML:** The basic structure of the page, including containers for the soda cans and background elements, is defined in the `index.html` file.
- **CSS:** All styling, animations, and transitions are handled in the `style.css` file. The CSS is written to be clean, modular, and easy to understand.
